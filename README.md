# Datasets from old tenpy versions

This repo exists to provide data for tests of https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy.

Specifically the [I/O test](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy/tree/main/tests/export_import_test).

There is an workflow / Github Action that can automatically generate datasets for missing
versions, up to creating a PR.
It currently needs to be [triggered manually](https://github.com/tenpy/io_example_data/actions/workflows/create.yml).
