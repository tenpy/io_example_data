# Datasets from old tenpy versions

This repo exists to provide data for tests of https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy.

Specifically the I/O tests at https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy

There is an workflow / Github Action that can automatically generate datasets for missing
versions, up to creating a PR.
It currently needs to be triggered manually (from the Actions tab of the repo).
